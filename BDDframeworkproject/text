--> Behave is behaviour driven development python style
--> Behave operates on directories containing.
--> Feature files written by your business analyst /sponsor/ whoever with your behaviour scenarios in it,and
--> a steps directory with python step implementations for the scenarios.

BDD Scenarios and Feature Files in gherkin

In bdd we have 3 main components:-
1.Feature files  ---> extension --> .feature
2.Scenarios      --->
3.Steps

Feature files:--Its seem like test suite
Scenarios --> its similar like test case
Steps:-- Step to perform test cases.


Scenarios : Title/Short description
    Given [A Precondition]
    When [some event]
    Then [Some Outcome]

Example:-1
Feature :OrangeHRM Login
Scenario:Logo presence on OrangeHRM home page
    Given: I launch chrome browser
    When i open orange hrm homepage
    Then i verify that the logo present on page

Example:- 2
Scenario:Login to orangeHRM
    Given I launch chrome browser
    When i open orange hrm homepage
    And Enter username and password
    And Click on login button
    Then user must successfully login to the dashboard page



Python behave with selenium :--
1) Project creation
2) First Selenium Test

Package we need :-- selenium package
                --> behave package

Selenium -->Driver for browser

Step parameters:--

Scenario outline:--By this we can execute multiple times steps .Like we can perform data driven testing using this

Background :- Executing number of steps before each scenario
same as tear down in robot framework.





Gherkin keyword :-
Given:- The "Given" step describes the initial stage of the system or preconditions
It outlines what happened in the past or the state of the system before any actions take place

When:-  The "When" step is used to describe the actions performed by the user or the system.
Multiple "When" statement can be used in a feature.
To improve readability ,its recommended to use the "And" keyword when multiple "When" steps are used.


Then:-The "Then" step outlines the expected outcome after the actions are performed.
It describes what should happen when the action is executed



Step to avoid:-
The "Given" step should not be used to perform actions
Its meant for describing the initial state or preconditions of the system ,not for action execution.

tags in bdd :-
command to execute the test case using tags name:-
@tags_name in feature file in above each scenerio
behave --tags =tags_name
if we want to execute multiple tags :-
behave --tags =tag1,tags2 etc (logical OR)
behave --tags=@tag1,@tag2

if we want skip particular tags name:-
behave --tags=~tags_name


Allure reports:--
pip3 install allure-behave
command to generate allure reports:-
behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports/ features

Allure reports is geerated in form of json.

To convert json to html reports then we use one simple command:-
allure serve reports/
